# Text Multiclass Classification
This project aims to perform text multiclass classification using various machine learning models. The goal is to preprocess the text data, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implement and evaluate linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) models. The project focuses on BBC News text data and achieves an impressive accuracy of 98% using SVM, NB, and Random Forest (RF) algorithms.

## Project Overview
- Developed text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to prepare the data for analysis.
- Visualized key trends and insights using word cloud visualization.
- Implemented and compared different machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF).
- Achieved a high accuracy of 98% in the multiclass classification task.

## Project Details
1. Data Collection and Preparation
- Combined all raw files into a single dataframe for ease of analysis.
2. Text Preprocessing
- Applied tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to preprocess the text data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns or trends.
- Utilized word cloud visualization to highlight key terms and themes in the text data.
4. Model Development and Evaluation
- Implemented linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) models.
- Compared the performance of the models based on accuracy.
- Achieved an impressive accuracy of 98% in the multiclass classification task.

## Results
The project achieves an impressive accuracy of 98% in the multiclass classification task using linear SVM and Naive Bayes models. The EDA provides valuable insights into the dataset, and the word cloud visualization helps identify key terms and themes in the text data.
